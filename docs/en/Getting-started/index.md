# Getting started

ReDeathmatch is a AMXModX plugins to provide Deathmatch gameplay in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike/">Counter-Strike 1.6</a> optimized to work with <a href="https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS">ReGameDLL_CS</a>.

The mod is a completely rewritten implementation of [CSDM ReAPI](https://github.com/wopox1337/CSDM-ReAPI), to replace legacy code.

Mod made a look back on the successful experience [CSDM 2.1.2 by BAILOPAN](https://www.bailopan.net/csdm), but using modern features of the new [ReGameDLL_CS](https://github.com/s1lentq/ReGameDLL_CS).

A variety of functions have long been built-in and optimized to work directly in ReGameDLL_CS. The ReDeathmatch system mostly just switches game settings and provides a convenient way to control most of the functionality.
